# Self-Supervised PPG Representation Learning Shows High Inter-Subject Variability
 This repository contains the implementation of a  Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) framework for PPG (photoplethysmography) signal representation learning, as introduced in our paper 'Self-Supervised PPG Representation Learning Shows High Inter-Subject Variability.' The project explores the use of SSL to overcome the challenges of label scarcity in PPG data analysis, focusing on a task like activity recognition. It demonstrates how SSL can leverage signal reconstruction as a pretext task to learn informative, generalized PPG representations. However, there is still high inter-subject variability in these learned representations, which makes working with this data more challenging when labeled data is scarce.
